    <h5><span style='color:#EF7300;'>Rick Charles</span> - VP at Western States Fire Protection</h5>
    <p>I have been in this industry for over twenty years and I only know of about two freelance designers. They are just hard to find. DesignerHub has become a great resource for us to find that next freelance designer for our next project. Being the largest union fire protection company in the country, and with dozens of offices in the western United States, I would recommend DesignerHub to all our branches needing design help. </p>
